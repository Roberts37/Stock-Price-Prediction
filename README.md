# Stock Market Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
The "Stock Market Price Prediction with LSTM" project is aimed at predicting stock prices by leveraging deep learning techniques. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model building, and deployment to create a comprehensive solution for traders and investors. It also provides valuable insights into data-driven decision-making and risk management. This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock market prices. It provides a deep learning solution to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. By utilizing TensorFlow and LSTM layers, the model captures temporal patterns in time series data, allowing for more informed trading and investment decisions.


## Usage
1. Data Collection: Gather historical stock price data for the stock or index you want to predict.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data to clean, engineer features, and normalize it for the model.

3. Model Building: Use the Jupyter notebooks or scripts to build and train the LSTM model.

4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. Visualization: Create visualizations to compare predicted stock prices with actual prices.

6. Deployment (Optional): Deploy the model as an API or web application for real-time predictions.

## Results
- The model successfully predicts stock prices based on historical data.
- Evaluation metrics indicate how closely the model's predictions align with actual stock prices.
- Visualizations offer insights into the model's performance and help traders and investors make informed decisions.
